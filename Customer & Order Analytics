#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> "Order ID";

#2. How many of those orders in January sales were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> "Order ID";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS f
ON c.order_ID = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID";

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price) AS price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID"
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT location, SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer.acctnum), ROUND (AVG(feb_sale.Quantity*feb_sale.price),2) AS avg_price
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customer
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb_sale
ON customer.order_ID = feb_sale.orderID
WHERE feb_sale.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID";

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
